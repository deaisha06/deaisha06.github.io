## My Interest
-  I have many interests but my top three would be spending time with my two dogs, watching movies/anime and being at home.
## Websites I recommend
-  [YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com) - I use Youtube for everything from entertainment to learning how to change the backtail light for my car. I find Youtube very useful especially for learning about different topics.
-  [Crunchyroll] (https://www.crunchyroll.com) - Crunchyroll is my favorite streaming service for watching anime. It has a huge selection.
